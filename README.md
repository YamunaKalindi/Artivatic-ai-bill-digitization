**Medical Bill Digitization using LayoutLMv3
**
**Overview - 
**
This project presents a layout-aware multimodal transformer-based solution for automated structured extraction from hospital billing documents.
The system is designed to:
Handle diverse hospital bill formats (IPD, OPD, Pharmacy, Diagnostic, Discharge, etc.)
Extract structured schema-aligned fields
Generalize across layout variations
Achieve high accuracy with domain fine-tuning
Maintain low inference cost and fast response time

The architecture was validated using the FUNSD (Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents) dataset, achieving ~80% F1 score using BIO token classification.

**Motivation**
Traditional OCR + Regex pipelines fail because:
They rely purely on text patterns
They break across layout variations
They cannot generalize to new templates
They require manual rule updates
Hospital bills vary significantly across institutions, making rule-based systems unreliable.
This project instead uses a layout-aware transformer model (LayoutLMv3) that jointly learns:
Textual semantics
2D spatial structure
Visual layout patterns

**Validation on FUNSD Dataset**

To validate the architecture:

**Dataset**: FUNSD (Noisy scanned forms)

**Model**: LayoutLMv3-base

**Training**: Supervised fine-tuning with BIO tagging

**Evaluation Metric**: Token-level F1 (SeqEval)

**Result**

Achieved ~0.80 F1 score

Demonstrates strong layout generalization capability

This confirms robustness on noisy scanned documents with diverse structures.

**Structured JSON Output**

The system aggregates BIO token predictions into structured spans.

Example Output:

{
  "document_id": "83823750.json",
  "extracted_fields": {
    "HEADER": ["Robert H. Shaw, Esq. November 11, 1997"],
    "QUESTION": ["Sender", "Reference", "Confidentiality Note"],
    "ANSWER": ["Charles Duggan", "83823750"]
  }
}

The same aggregation logic can be mapped to hospital billing schema fields such as:

Patient Name

Bill Number

Admission Date

Discharge Date

Total Amount

Tax

Line Items

**Accuracy Optimization Strategy (Target ≥95%)**

To achieve ≥95% field-level accuracy on hospital bills:

**Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning
**
Fine-tune LayoutLMv3 on hospital billing dataset

Schema-specific BIO labels

**Schema-Constrained Decoding**

Enforce single-value constraints

Field priority logic

**Numeric Validation Layer**

Subtotal + Tax ≈ Total verification

Currency normalization

Date format validation

**Confidence-Based Filtering**

Use prediction probabilities

Reject low-confidence fields

**Hybrid Numeric Stabilization (Optional)**

Lightweight rule-based fallback for numeric fields

This hybrid learning + validation approach enables reliable ≥95% structured extraction accuracy.
